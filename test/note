 unit testing is done by the help of mocking. it is only useful here
 there is no other place where mocking is required or used

 1. We want request body
 2. call the rest api.
 3. active database :- new databse which is primarily for testing
 4. test and validate the actual response

 Q. For making the rest call ?
 ans. We would be using " supertest " library.

 Q. test database
 ans. Inmemory mongodb. It is a npm dependencies. It's very light weight. name of dependency is " mongodb-memory-server " 

 in the test folder we will create the file " db.js ".
